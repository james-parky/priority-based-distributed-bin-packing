# Priority Based Distributed Bin Packing Algorithm

## Usage:

This is a duplicate of the code embedded on the portal's /matching page, except it has some JavaScript methods swapped to node.js methods, such as fetch(). The code in the portal does not need the imports for these functions, but if you are to run the code in isolation in a terminal, you can use the following commands.

-   Inside the root directory run `node match.js`
-   If required modules are missing, you can download them both using:
    -   `npm -i node-fetch`
    -   `npm -i fs`
